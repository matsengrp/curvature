\section{Introduction}

\section{Rooted SPR Neighborhoods}

\begin{lemma}
Let $T$ and $S$ be phylogenetic trees such that $\dspr{T,S}=1$, that is $T$ can be transformed into $S$ by moving a subtree $R$ with $k$ leaves.
The corresponding SPR operation moves $R$ from its position adjacent to subtree $U$ to a location adjacent to subtree $V$.
If multiple SPR moves transform $T$ into $S$ (i.e. an NNI\todo{lemma}), then assume that $V$ is the aunt of $R$ in $T$.
Let $L$ be the $\lca{U,V}$ in $T$.
Let $a$ be the distance from $U$ to $L$ in $T$, and $b$ the distance from $V$ to $L$ in $T$.
Let $i$ be the number of leaves in $U$, excluding any leaves of $R$, and $j$ be the number of leaves in $V$, excluding any leaves of $R$.
Then the degree of $T$ and $S$ differs by:
$$(2k-1)(a-b-1) + 2(i - j).$$

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

Proof strategy:

Gain $(2k-1)(a-2)$ moves from the $a$-path to $R$.

Lose $(2k-1)(b-1)$ moves from the $b$-path to $R$.

Gain $2(i-j)$ moves involving the parent of $R$ to $U$ and $V$.

\end{proof}



\section{Curvature}

Note that we have to write out simple random walk versus degree-informed.
Can we just say that degree differences are small relative to $n$? Is that true?


\begin{proposition}
Fix a positive integer $k$ and let $R$ be a tree with $k$ leaves.
Let $\{T_n \mid n > k\}$ be a sequence of phylogenetic trees all containing $R$, and let $\{S_n \mid n > k\}$ be the same sequence but with $R$ cut off and attached at a different location for each $T_n$.
Then $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \kappa(T_n, S_n) = 0$ on the SPR graph.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
First we show that $\kappa$ is bounded above by $(q_n+3(2k-1)(O(n)))/q_n$, where $q_n$ is the number of neighbors of $T_n$ (OK, this gets messy when $T_n$ and $S_n$ have different numbers of neighbors).
Let $T'_n$ be any SPR move away from $T_n$ where the SPR move does not cut $R$ into two and doesn't exclusively move $R$.
In the mass transport, we pair $T'_n$ with $S'_n$, which is the same move applied to $S_n$ (need to show this makes sense), such that $\dspr(T'_n, S'_n) = 1$.
This works for every tree that doesn't have $R$ cut in two.
The number of trees that \emph{do} have $R$ cut in two or moved by its root is $(2k-1)(O(n))$, and their distance is at most 3.

A lower bound is also available because that we can't do better than distance 1 for all $(T'_n, S'_n)$ pairs.
If we completely ignore the $(2k-1)(O(n))$ trees that cut $R$ in two, then we get a lower bound of $(q_n-(2k-1)(O(n)))/q_n$.

The proposition follows because $q_n$ is quadratic in $n$.
\end{proof}


\section{$k$-tubes}

The curvature with respect to two topologies, $T_1$ and $T_2$, is primarily determined by a subset of the SPR graph in the localized neighborhood of these topologies.
We first require some notation to define these subsets.
Let $\TT$ be the full set of topologies with a given number of leaves.
Denote the set of trees with SPR distance at most $k$ from a given tree $T$ by $N_k(T)$.
These trees are the $k$-neighbors of $T$.
That is, $$ N_k(T) = \set{t \in \TT \mid \dspr{T, t} \le k} .$$

We now define the $k$-tube of two trees $T_1$ and $T_2$ to be the union of their $k$-neighbors and \emph{every tree on a shortest path between a $k$-neighbor of $T_1$ and a $k$-neighbor of $T_2$}.
More formally, the $k$-tube for $T_1$ and $T_2$ is:
\[ \set{t \in \TT \mid \dspr{t, t_1} + \dspr{t, t_2} = \dspr{t_1, t_2},\ \exists_{t_1 \in N_k(T_1)},\ \exists_{t_2 \in N_k(T_2)} } .\]
We call $T_1$ and $T_2$ the centers of the $k$-tube.
The distance between $k$-neighbors of different central trees is bounded by the maximum distance from each $k$-neighbor to its respective center and the maximum distance between the centers:

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:neighbor_distance}
	$\dspr{t_1, t_2} \le \dspr{T_1, T_2} + 2k,\ \forall_{t_1 \in N_k(T_1)},\ \forall_{t_2 \in N_k(T_2)}.$
\end{lemma}

To efficiently compute a $k$-tube, we first bound the maximum distance from members of the $k$-tube to the closest central tree.
\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:k_tube_distance}
	Any tree $t$ of the $k$-tube of two trees $T_1$ and $T_2$ satisfies:
	\[ \min\left({\dspr{t, T_1}, \dspr{t, T_2}}\right) \le \floor{\dspr{T_1, T_2}/2} + 2k .\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Without loss of generality, assume that $t$ is on a shortest path between two trees $t_1 \in N_k(T_1)$ and $t_2 \in N_k(T_2)$, and is either closer to $t_1$ than $t_2$ or equidistant from both.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:neighbor_distance} there is a path of length at most $\dspr{T_1, T_2} + 2k$ between $t_1$ and $t_2$.
Then $\dspr{t, t_1} \le \floor{(\dspr{T_1, T_2} + 2k) / 2}$.

Along with the fact that $\dspr{T_1, t_1} \le k$, we have that
\begin{align*}
\dspr{t, T_1} &\le \dspr{t, t_1} + \dspr{t_1, T_1} \\
&\le \floor{(\dspr{T_1, T_2} + 2k) / 2} + k \\
&\le \floor{\dspr{T_1, T_2} / 2} + 2k.
\end{align*}

\end{proof}
We can thus restrict our search for members of the $k$-tube to topologies of distance at most $\floor{\dspr{T_1, T_2}/2} + 2k$ from the central trees.
We call this set of trees $k$-tube candidates.
Note that there are $\OhOf{n^{2(\floor{\dspr{T_1, T_2}/2} + 2k)}}$ $k$-tube candidates.
We identify these candidates by iterating over increasingly large $k$-neighbourhoods of $T_1$ and $T_2$, and removing duplicate topologies through hashing.  \todo{We might be able to do better by using ``edge protection'' to avoid duplicates. I need to check how accurately neighbourhood sizes follow the naive $\OhOf(n^{2k})$ bound.}

In the second part of our procedure for computing a $k$-tube, we identify $k$-tube candidates that are not on the shortest path between two $k$-neighbors of the central trees.
We first compute shortest path lengths from each member of $N_k(T_1)$ to each $k$-tube candidate using breadth-first search (BFS).
For each BFS traversal tree, we backtrack from members of $N_k(T_2)$, identifying topologies in the $k$-tube.
We can use unique tree indices here, rather than hashing, to avoid duplicates.
The size of $N_k(T_1)$ is $\OhOf{n^{2k}}$, so this takes
$\OhOf( n^{2k} M)$ time, where $M$ is the number of edges between $k$-tube candidates, that is, at most the square of the number of $k$-tube candidates. \todo{We could probably do something smarter by starting from trees that are 0, 1, etc SPRs from $T_1$.}

This procedure identifies exactly the trees in the $k$-tube, so we have the following lemma:
\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:k_tube_correctness}
	This procedure correctly identifies the $k$-tube.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	First, suppose that this procedure identifies a tree $x$ that is not in the $k$-tube.
	Assume, without loss of generality, that the BFS tree $B$ from tree $t_1 \in N_k(T_1)$ transitioned from $x$ to a $k$-tube tree $t$.
	Moreover, there must be a path in $B$ from $t$ to a tree $t_2 \in N_k(T_2)$ such that $t$ is on a shortest path from $t_1$ to $t_2$.
	Then, by the properties of BFS, $x$ is on this shortest path and belongs in the $k$-tube.

	Now, suppose that this procedure does not identify a tree $x$ that belongs in the $k$-tube.
	$x$ must be on a shortest path between some trees $t_1 \in N_k(T_1)$ and $t_2 \in N_k(T_2)$.
	Then, by the properties of BFS, $x$ would have been on the path from $t_1$ to $t_2$ in the $t_1$ BFS tree.
